    repo:/path:/filename:/extension:/in: qualifiers, ACL-scoped to the caller.

    ONE RESULT PER (repo, path) — the HEAD snapshot's. Real code search indexes the DEFAULT BRANCH
    only, while Backlot stores a row per snapshot of a path (see ``store._file_head_clause``), so
    without that restriction a path would answer once per revision it was ever recorded at and one
    repo's history would crowd the rest of the corpus out of the result set. The cost is deliberate,
    and it is real's cost too: a string surviving only in a SUPERSEDED snapshot is not findable
    here. It stays reachable by path at `/contents/{path}?ref=` and by digest at `/git/blobs/{sha}`.

    `Accept: application/vnd.github.text-match+json` adds `text_matches` — the part that makes a hit
    useful rather than merely located.

    A blank `q` is real's 422 rather than a listing: a code search with no term is a client bug
    better reported than answered with a corpus dump. `/search/issues` above answers a blank `q`
    the same way, and for the same measured reason.

    A `page` / `per_page` that is not an unsigned 32-bit integer, or a `q`, `page` or `per_page`
    given twice, is refused once the credential is, and in text/plain: of the ten GitHub surfaces
    measured this is the one that does not absorb such a value (see
    :func:`backlot.pagination.github_code_search_query_refusal` for the measured shape). The
    `PageParam` validator has already absorbed it by the time this runs, so the raw query string is
    what is read. The order is real's: an unauthenticated request with `per_page=abc` is the 401,
    an authenticated one the 400, and the 400 precedes the blank-`q` 422 (measured 2026-09-06). The
    401 is the router's before any handler runs, so what this function's order settles is only
    that the parse is refused before the query is read.

    Then the depth. Code search serves the first 1000 results and refuses a page that would REACH
    past them, `page * per_page > 1000`: at 30 a page, page 33 (results 961 to 990) is served and
    page 34 (991 to 1020) refused, at 7 a page, 142 is served and 143 refused, at 1 a page, 1000 is
    served and 1001 refused, at 100 a page, 10 is served and 11 refused, and `per_page=101` is
    refused at 11 too because it is served at 100. The total does not enter: a 44-result search
    refuses page 34 at 30 a page after serving pages 3 to 33 empty. That is not `/search/issues`'s
    line, which serves page 34 in full and refuses the page that STARTS past 1000 (both rules are
    :func:`backlot.pagination.github_search_depth_refused`'s). The refusal comes after the blank-`q`
    422 and before the `repo:` qualifier is read: `repo:psf/ghost-zz-9876` at page 11 of 100 is
    this 422, not the qualifier's answer (all measured 2026-09-06).

    A ref that exists resolves to the repo's snapshot commit, since Backlot keeps no commit
    history (see :func:`get_tree`). WHICH refs exist is knowable, and real 404s the rest:

    - ``heads/{name}`` for a name :func:`_branch_names` holds. `heads/totally-made-up` is a 404 on
      psf/requests, and answering it here made "which branches does this repo have" resolve one
      way through ``/branches`` and another through this route.
    - ``pull/{n}/head`` for a pull that exists, and ``pull/{n}/merge`` only while it is still
      OPEN. Real drops the merge ref when the pull closes: on psf/requests, #7616 (merged) and
      #7589 (closed, unmerged) answer 404 on ``…/merge`` and 200 on ``…/head``, where open #7586
      answers 200 on both. A number that names no pull is a 404 either way (#999999 on
      pydantic/pydantic). Restricting this route to branches would 404 a ref real resolves.
    - ``tags/{name}`` for a tag the repo states. One it does not state has nothing to resolve to,
      which is the same answer ``/tags`` gives for it.
    - Nothing else — ``refs/heads/main``, the fully-qualified git spelling, included. Real takes
      ``heads/main`` here and 404s the qualified form with the get-a-reference endpoint's own body
      (measured on psf/requests), so it is a missing ref rather than a missing route. This used to
      be stripped and accepted, which let a client sending the git spelling pass here and 404 in
      production. The ref this route ANSWERS with is still fully qualified, as real's is.

    """The repo's file set as a git tree (real API shape). `recursive`, sent with any value,
    returns every blob/tree entry; without it, only the entries directly under root. Measured on
    psf/requests on 2026-10-03: `0`, `false` and an empty value recursed like `1`, `true` and
    `abc`, and only a request without the parameter answered the flat tree.

    `ref` selects WHICH tree, exactly as on real GitHub: a SUBTREE's own sha — the one a client
    reads out of a parent listing's `tree` entry — answers that directory's entries, with paths
    relative to it. That is how a client walks a repo one level at a time (fsspec's
    `GithubFileSystem` does), and answering the root instead does not fail loudly: it reports the
    root's entries under the child's name, so listing `src` yields `src/src` and `src/config` and a
    recursive walk descends until it runs out of stack.

    Everything else `ref` may be is a commit-ish resolving to the ROOT tree — a branch name, or a
    sha this server hands out as a commit (see :func:`_commit_ish`). A ref that is none of those is
    a 404, as on real, where both `totally-made-up` and a 40-hex sha naming no object answer 404
    (measured on psf/requests). This route used to answer the root for any of them, which made a
    name no branch listing held resolve to a tree.

    A subtree sha resolves PER CALLER, because the entries it is matched against are already
    `visible_ids`-scoped: a token that can see nothing inside a folder does not find that folder's
    sha, and gets a 404 where a wider token gets the folder. No content crosses the ACL.

    **A tree keeps no history**, so every other `ref` — a branch name, or a sha from /branches,
    /commits or git/ref — resolves to the repo's CURRENT root. FILES themselves do have history: a
    corpus may state several snapshots of one path, and `/contents/{path}?ref=` reaches them (see
    :func:`get_contents`). What has no per-ref shape is the tree — there is no mapping from a ref to
    the set of snapshots that were current at it — so this route answers HEAD for every ref, and a
    path appears exactly once however many snapshots it holds. Two consequences a client author will
    otherwise assume away:

    - Pinning to a commit sha gives no immutability guarantee. A blob sha is content-addressed and
      stable, but the tree a commit sha resolves to moves whenever the corpus changes, so caching a
      snapshot against a commit sha caches a moving target.
    - Because there is no before/after state, a pull's changeset is synthesized out of this same
      snapshot rather than diffed from it (see :func:`_pr_files`) — which is also why a file the
      changeset reports as `removed` is still present here.

    The ref is the trailing PATH, as on `git/ref`: a branch name may contain a slash and real
    resolves one here (`git/trees/bug/5671` on psf/requests answers that branch's tree).

    add it back, exactly as real behaves for a pull whose branch was deleted under it. The default
    branch is listed either way; a repo record that omits it from `branches` has still named it.

    **Inferred otherwise**, from the pulls, measured on api.github.com (2026-09-03):

    - An OPEN pull's same-repo head ref is a branch — 27 of 27 across seven repos. Omitting it told
      a client that reads a pull and then resolves its head here that the branch was deleted or
      lives in a fork, contradicting `head.repo.full_name` in the same pull.
    - A MERGED pull's head ref is not — 0 of 54 across ten repos, GitHub's "automatically delete
      head branches" at work. This is the one place the listing must not hold what a pull says.
    - A CLOSED-but-unmerged pull's head ref is left out with it, and that one is a coin toss rather
      than a rule: 6 of 28 such heads still exist. Neither answer is right often enough to be
      right, which is what a repo record exists to settle — a corpus that knows says so, and this
      inference stops guessing for it.
    - A FORK's head ref is not either: it is a branch of the fork. `head_repo` is how a corpus says
      so — a `head_repo` naming THIS repo is not a fork — and without it every pull looked
      same-repo.
    - A `base.ref` is a branch, always, whether or not it is the default branch (pydantic/pydantic
      lists its non-default base `pure-annotation-schema-cache`). A base outlives the pull on it.

    A pull the corpus states no refs for still advertises the fallbacks used here, so they are
    listed for the same reason a stated ref is: the listing has to hold what the pulls say.

    `protected` is false throughout an inferred listing — a pull cannot imply protection — which is
    why `?protected=` only really selects for a repo that states its branches.

    Scoped to `ids` when inferred: pulls are ACL-filtered, so the branches drawn from them are too.
    Deliberate, and the same answer `/user/repos` already gives — a caller who cannot see the pull
    is not told its branch exists — rather than a side effect of where the material happens to
    live. A STATED listing is the same for every caller, because the record it comes from carries

    The templates are how an SDK completes a repository lazily — PyGithub expands them for the

    work hypermedia exists to remove. All of them derive from owner/repo; none needs stored data.

    what can be fetched is a worse deal than a short one, and short is something the caller can

    absent for a subtler version of the same reason — Backlot serves `/git/ref/{ref}`, singular,

# --- pull request changesets ----------------------------------------------------
#
# WHICH files a pull changed comes from its `changed_paths` when the corpus declared it. Nothing
# records the HUNKS, so those are always synthesized — deterministically, seeded on the pull's
# served key — but they invent no content: every line on either side is a line of that file's own
# snapshot. A `modified` file's "before" state is the snapshot with one real block either taken out
# or duplicated (see _patch_modified), so the hunk is a well-formed diff against real bytes in both
# directions. Without `changed_paths` the file list is chosen deterministically too, which is
# well-formed but unrelated to what the pull is about.
#
# What that buys, none of which was reachable before: a client's diff path, its handling of an
# omitted `patch`, and — for a corpus that declares more paths than one page holds — its paging over
# a changed-file list. A synthesized list caps at _MAX_CHANGED_FILES and will not fill a page.
#
# THE SNAPSHOT IS THE PULL'S HEAD. Every hunk here is expressed against that one convention, which
# is what makes the diff actually apply: `git apply --reverse` walks the snapshot back to the base
# (tests/test_github.py checks exactly that with real git). Two consequences:
#   - A repo with no `file` docs has an EMPTY changeset, and the pull object's counts follow it to
#     zero. There is no snapshot to diff, and naming a file the repo does not contain would
#     contradict its own tree.
#   - `status: "removed"` is NOT produced. A deleted file is absent from the head, but the snapshot
#     is the only state Backlot has, so a file it names as removed would still be in the tree — and
#     a diff mixing that with a `modified` hunk claims the snapshot is base and head at once, which
#     no client can apply. Deletions come from the `dedup` flavour below instead.

_MAX_CHANGED_FILES = 3  # only bounds a SYNTHESIZED changeset; `changed_paths` is taken in full

# Real GitHub omits `patch` from the JSON file object for a binary file or a diff too large to
