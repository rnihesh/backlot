    `+`/`-`, case-insensitively and ignoring whitespace — see :func:`_jira_order_desc` — and
    answers 400 for anything else. Reproduced, because accepting one silently would serve corpus
    order to a client that asked for something else with nothing in the response to say the sort
    was dropped — and would pass here while failing against Jira. Its own message is localised to
    the account's language, so the wording is not reproduced, only the refusal.

    # BEFORE the issue is resolved. Measured 2026-09-10: a bad `orderBy` on a key that does

    # parameter is checked first. It separates nothing a caller could not already tell — the
    # 400 is identical for a key that exists, one hidden from the caller, and one that never
    # existed.
    #
    # An ABSENT `orderBy` is "not asked" and leaves the corpus's own order alone. What real Jira
    # returns without one is not established: its REST intro says responses are "listed in
    # ascending order by default", but that is a general statement its own operations contradict

    # available for measuring had no issue carrying a comment. Sorting on that would be picking a
    # default, not reproducing one.

    # The integers are read here too, and BEFORE `orderBy`, because the binder outranks both. All
    # measured 2026-09-15: `?maxResults=abc` on a key that does not exist is the conversion 400
    # where the same key alone is 404; `?maxResults=abc&orderBy=bogus` is the conversion 400 in
    # either query order; and `?startAt=abc&maxResults=xyz` names `startAt` in either order, which

#
#   ?maxResults=          the default, as though unsent -- an empty value is not a failure
#   ?maxResults=%2B3      3, so a leading sign is read (a RAW `+` decodes to a space and reaches
#                         the binder as ` 3`, which reads 3 by the whitespace removal below)
#   ?maxResults=%203%20   3, and ?maxResults=3%204 is 34 -- whitespace is REMOVED, not trimmed
#   ?maxResults=<U+0663>  3, so the digits are Unicode's, not ASCII's
#   ?maxResults=1_0       400 -- where Python's own int() reads 10

# and the non-breaking spaces `strip_java_whitespace` exists for — so those three are handled here
# and the rest is left to `int` rather than restated as a pattern that would then have to be kept
# in step with it.

#
#   - whitespace and nothing else. Jira reads it as absent and answers 200 with the default

#     fails to convert THAT, reporting `For input string: ""`. A genuinely empty `?limit=` is the
#     default on both, so it is the whitespace, not the emptiness, that separates them.
#   - an empty FIRST value of a repeated parameter. Jira takes the default (`?startAt=&startAt=5`);
#     Confluence refuses, naming `",5"`. See :func:`_int_param`.
#
# The WIDTH is per parameter, not per product, and measured one parameter at a time: Jira's
# `startAt` takes a Java long (`2147483648` and `9223372036854775807` are both echoed back, and
# only past a long is it refused), while its `maxResults` and both Confluence parameters are a Java

    Measured 2026-09-15. The `Content-Type` is checked FIRST and on its own: a perfectly good JSON
    body sent without the header is the same 415 as one sent with `text/plain`, so the header
    decides before the bytes are looked at. The match is on the media type alone, case-insensitively
    and ignoring parameters — `APPLICATION/JSON` and `application/json; charset=utf-8` are both
    read, `*/*` and `application/xml` are not.

    Then the body, which real sorts into three sentences, and the boundaries between them are not
    where a JSON parser would draw them:

    - a body of zero length, and a literal `null`, are "no content"
    - bytes that do not parse are a parse error — but a body that is only WHITESPACE is not, it is
      the not-an-object sentence, which is why emptiness here means length and not `strip()`
    - JSON that parses to anything but an object — `[]`, `5`, `"x"`, `true` — is not-an-object

    Trailing bytes after a complete value are IGNORED rather than refused: `{"jql": …} junk` is
    answered 200. That is what `raw_decode` reproduces and `json.loads` would not, reading the
    first value and letting the rest go.

    The leading bytes are the other side of that and are NOT ignored so freely. JSON's whitespace is
    the four ASCII ones, so a non-breaking space in front of the object is the parse error, where
    `str.lstrip()` would skip it and read the object behind it. Bytes that are not UTF-8 are the
    not-an-object sentence, where `errors="replace"` would repair them into U+FFFD and parse.

    under `content/{id}` on 2026-09-23: `?limit=-1` and `?start=-1` are 400. Unclamped they reached
    SQLite, which reads a negative LIMIT as no limit at all — so the answer to `?limit=-1` was the
    whole collection.

    Order is measured too, because both parameters can be wrong at once. Conversion comes first for
    BOTH — `?limit=-1&start=abc` is the conversion failure about `abc`, not the negative about
    `limit` — and among two negatives `start` is the one named: `?limit=-1&start=-1` reports
    `start cannot be less than zero`.

    The CQL search reads its own pair: it is not Spring-bound and refuses a value it cannot convert
    as a bodiless 404. It shares :func:`_refuse_negative_page_params`, which is measured on that
    route too.

    ``start_bound`` is `content`'s alone and sits between the two refusals above, measured with
    both wrong at once: `?limit=abc&start=100001` is the conversion failure, `?limit=-1&
    start=100001` the bound, and `?spaceKey=NOPE&start=100001` the bound rather than the unknown
    space's 404.

    answers an empty page (:func:`backlot.errors.atlassian.zero_limit_not_allowed`). It is reached
    after both refusals above, measured 2026-09-23: `?limit=0&start=abc` is the conversion failure
    and `?limit=0&start=-1` the negative about `start`.

    ``default`` and ``cap`` are per route, measured 2026-09-22 on a live site: `content`, `space`
    and `child/comment` cap `limit` at 1000, `label` defaults to 200 and caps there, `child/page`
    defaults to 25 and caps nowhere (`?limit=1001` is echoed), and the CQL search caps nowhere
    either. A value above the cap is answered with the cap rather than refused, so a client asking
