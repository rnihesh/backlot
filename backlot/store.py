"""Read-only SQLite access layer.

One table per service, with that service's own columns and its own grouping-unit table
(``slack_channels``, ``github_repos``, …) — never one crammed ``documents`` table, so a column
one service needs never lands on another's rows. The principal / group-membership relationship
tables are shared, keyed by names that ARE globally unique. ACL grants are not: each source has
its own ``<source>_acl`` table (see ``ACL_TABLE``), because a served id is unique only *within* a
source — a shared table keyed on one let two documents in different sources that happened to share
an id merge their grants.

**A row is identified by the id the API serves it under, and by nothing else**. The dataset's
own identifier scheme does not survive the import: a corpus's ``doc_id`` seeds a synthesized value
and is then discarded, so there is no ``doc_id`` column anywhere and no map from one. Each table's
PRIMARY KEY is that served id — see :data:`ID_COLUMNS`, which also names it, since the column is
spelled the way its vendor spells it (``number``, ``key``, ``ts``, otherwise ``id``).

Every doc table carries ``author_email`` and ``content`` after its identifier and its grouping
column, plus ``title`` on the ten sources whose documents have one (see ``TITLELESS``), which is
what keeps listing / ACL / pagination uniform via the ``GROUPING`` registry. Every listing takes
``visible_ids``: ``None`` = admin, otherwise results are filtered to docs whose ACL grants intersect
it. JSON columns are TEXT — read with :func:`jcol`.

# The direction is not documented; ASCENDING is the choice here because it is the only one that
