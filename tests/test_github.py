    """GitHub's OpenAPI description declares `state` on the issue and the pull listing as
    `{type: string, enum: [open, closed, all], default: open}`, described "Indicates the state of
    the issues to return." on the one and "Either `open`, `closed`, or `all` to filter by state." on
    the other (read 2026-09-09). Backlot's document declared `{type: string, default: open}` with
    no enum and no description, so a generated client or an agent reading the MCP slice had the
    default and nothing on what else the parameter takes.

    Outside the enum the two routes part, measured on api.github.com on 2026-09-09 against
    `psf/requests`. The issue listing refuses: `state=bogus`, `state=OPEN` and `state=` (empty) are
    each a 422, `Validation Failed`, one `errors` entry carrying the value sent with
    `resource: Issue`, `field: state`, `code: invalid`, `documentation_url`
    `https://docs.github.com/v3/issues/#list-issues`, `content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8`;
    the repository comes first, so the same value on `psf/ghost-zz-9876` is the 404 with the route's
    own anchor. The pull listing absorbs: `pulls?state=bogus` and `?state=OPEN` answer the 87 rows
    `state=open` answers, where `closed` and `all` answer other, larger sets. Backlot filtered on the
    value as sent and answered an empty 200 on both routes, which is neither answer. The corpus is
    built here because no repository in the sample holds an open pull beside a closed one, which is
    what tells the open set from an empty one.

    `components/parameters`, read 2026-09-07 and again 2026-09-09), each under a description on the
    parameter itself. Sixteen of the seventeen routes served here that page reference the two; the
    seventeenth, `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/statuses/{sha}`, is the legacy alias the description
    names only in the prose of `/commits/{ref}/statuses`, which references them. The three routes
    whose inline `per_page` default differs — `/notifications` at 50,
    `/orgs/{org}/copilot/billing/seats` at 50 and `/organizations/{org}/settings/billing/budgets`
    at 10 — are indeed unserved here; `/zen` declares no parameters at all, so it is not in that
    set. Backlot's slice declared neither default and neither description: FastAPI writes no default
    for a parameter whose runtime default is None, and the handlers keep None to tell an unsent size
    from a sent one. The spec is what `backlot mcp` hands an agent as a tool, so a default the
    document does not state is one the agent cannot know.

    The description matters for one number: "(max 100)" is the ONLY place real states `per_page`'s
    cap. Its schema is a bare `{type: integer}` with no `maximum`, and that absence is a
    declaration, not an oversight: real serves `per_page=101` at the cap rather than refusing it
    (`test_github_pages_at_reals_thirty_and_caps_at_its_hundred`), so a schema bound would have a
    generated client refuse what the server accepts. A served document that declared `default: 30`
    with no ceiling left 500 looking legal when 500 comes back as 100. So this test holds the
    description to real's text and the schema to no bound, and it holds the 100 in the prose to the
    100 the route applies, since the text is built from that constant rather than spelled out twice.

    Both are written onto the served document after FastAPI builds it, on GitHub's operations
    alone: a Slack `page` keeps the schema its router declared by hand.

    Confluence disagree about, and ``test_notion_a_head_is_the_get_without_its_body``); a vendor

    `/orgs/PSF` answers `login: psf` and `url: .../orgs/psf`, and an issue item's `url`,
    `repository_url` and `html_url` are lowercase too — measured on api.github.com 2026-09-03,
    200 each with no redirect, so the normalization is in the body rather than in a `Location`.
    Echoing the caller's spelling gives one resource two identities: a client keying a cache on the
    url it got back stores both, and `/orgs/ACME` and `/orgs/acme` reported different `id`s, since
    the id is synthesized from the name it was asked with.

    Resolving the repo case-insensitively must not widen what a scoped token sees, which is the
    last two assertions: the name is canonicalized before the visibility check, never instead of
    it.

    PyGithub's `get_rate_limit()` raised before a crawl's first request.

    Measured against api.github.com on 2026-09-09 and 2026-09-10 (curl unauthenticated, `gh api`
    authenticated): `limit: 60` on `core` and `10` on `search` for a caller with no credential,
    `5000`, `30` and `10` on `core`, `search` and `code_search` for a token; the five on the 200s,
    on the 404 for a repository that does not exist, on the 401s, on the blank-`q` 422 (against
    `search`) and on the version 400; a `HEAD` counted once (`remaining` 46 → 45); the 401 an
    anonymous code search gets counted against `core`, not `code_search`; `reset` in epoch
    seconds, the same on every answer inside a window; `GET /rate_limit` 200 with
    `resources.core`, `.search`, `.code_search` each `{limit, used, remaining, reset}` and `rate`
    beside them under `2022-11-28` and not under `2026-03-10`, carrying the five itself and not
    counting (two reads in a row both `used: 0`); a bad bearer on it the 401. What real's route
    reports is a fresh window rather than the headers' (see the route's docstring); Backlot reports
    the headers'. Past the limit, real refuses (403, `used` pinned at `limit`) — see
    `rate_limit_refusal` for that measurement, taken 2026-09-17.

    Five more answers measured 2026-09-21, each against the function that carries its measurement:
    `SEARCH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`, `rate_limit_window`, `refused_a_credential`, `rate_limit_caller`
    and `honours_api_version`, with `_RESOURCE_ORDER` for the order the route lists them in.
