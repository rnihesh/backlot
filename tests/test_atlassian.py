# Measured against Jira Cloud on an issue with no comments, which settles every one of these:
# parameter validation runs before the issue is resolved. The dates differ and say which instance
# state each claim reflects — 2026-09-09 for the defaults, the clamps, the caps and `created` /
# `+created` / `-created` against `bogus`; 2026-09-10 for the rest of the `orderBy` grammar (one
# leading sigil, whitespace ignored, field case-insensitive), for the empty value being refused
# rather than read as absent, and for the 400 arriving before the 404.
#
# What `-created` does to a non-empty list comes from Atlassian's document rather than from a
# call, and the no-`orderBy` case from neither — see that test's own docstring.

# The corpus lists these OUT of chronological order on purpose: `comment 1` is the newest and
# `comment 7` the oldest. A fixture whose array order matches its clock cannot tell a real sort
# from `store.doc_comments`' `ORDER BY seq`, so every ascending assertion below would pass against
# an implementation that ignores `orderBy` altogether.
